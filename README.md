# Hi! I'm David Cerdeiro ðŸ‘‹
## Software Engineer
I am currently completing my Computer Engineering degree at the University of CÃ¡diz. :smile:

Through my studies and self-taught learning, I have developed a solid foundation in programming principles and problem-solving in software development. I have gained experience working with different programming languages, applying them in various projects throughout my academic journey and during my internship at NTT DATA.

:technologist: Since I was a child, I have been passionate about technology, starting with the world of video games, which sparked my interest in the systems behind them and technological development in general.

My career goal is to contribute value through my knowledge and logical thinking while continuing to grow in the field of software development.
